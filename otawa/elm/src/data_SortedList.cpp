/**
 * @class SortedList
 *
 * This class provides a sorted list implementation using single-link lists
 * (@ref List). Elements are sorted in increasing order of the used comparator.
 *
 * Its performances are not very good but the memory footprint
 * is very low. Use it only for small collection of elements.
 *
 * @par Performances
 * @li adding an item: O(n) worst, O(n/2) average.
 * @li looking/removing an item: O(n) worst, O(n/2) average.
 * @li memory footprint: same as @ref List.
 *
 * @par Implemented concepts
 * @ref elm::concept::Collection
 * @ref elm::concept::MutableCollection
 * @ref elm::concept::List
 *
 * @param T	Type of data stored in the list.
 * @param A	Adapter to access key part (must implement concept @ref elm::concept::Adapter).
 * @param C	Comparator of the stored items (must implement the concept @ref elm::concept::Comparator).
