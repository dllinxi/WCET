/**
 * @defgroup dcache Data Cache
 *
 * This module is dedicated to the categorisation of data cache accesses.
 * As for the instruction cache, four categories are handled:
 * @li @ref	otawa::cache::ALWAYS_HIT if the access results always in a hit,
 * @li @ref	otawa::cache::FIRST_MISS (also named persistent) if the first access is unknown and the following accesses results in hits,
 * @li @ref otawa::cache::ALWAYS_MISS if the access results always in a miss,
 * @li @ref otawa::cache::NOT_CLASSIFIED if the previous categories do not apply.
 *
 * The data cache description is obtained from the @ref otawa::hard::CACHE_CONFIGURATION_FEATURE feature
 * and the cache references are obtained from @ref otawa::ADDRESS_ANALYSIS_FEATURE. For the time being, this feature
 * is loosely implemented by @ref otawa::StackAnalysis. As this module may accepts several different address provider,
 * this processor must be runned by hand before the invocation of the processors of this module.
 *
 * Basically, the following phases are performed:
 * @li computation of block accesses -- for each basic block and instruction performing a cache access,
 * a list of accesses (@ref otawa::dcache::BlockAccess) is built and stored in the basic block,
 * @li ACS computation -- according to the accesses list, the ACS (Abstract Cache State) are computed (MUST, persistence and/or MAY analysis),
 * @li category derivation -- from the ACS computed in the previous phases, a category is computed and linked
 * to each block access,
 * @li time computation -- from the categories, the execution time of a block may be computed; yet, although this module
 * very trivial way to include this time (@ref otawa::dcache::CONSTRAINTS_FEATURE), more precise and sound results
 * are obtained by other integrated block time computation methods like ExeGraph.
 *
 * Notice that the MAY is only optional and must be called by hand. In the same way, there is no persistence
 * analysis unless the persistence level is passed at configuration.
 *
 * A category computation for data cache may look like:
 * @code
 * #include <otawa/util/StackAnalysis.h>
 * #include <otawa/dcache/features.h>
 *
 * using namespace otawa;
 *
 * void process(WorkSpace *ws) {
 * 	PropList props;
 * 	ws->require(STACK_ANALYSIS_FEATURE, props);
 * 	if(i_want_may_analysis)
 * 		ws->require(dcache::MAY_ACS_FEATURE);
 * 	if(i_want_persistence_analysis)
 *		dcache::DATA_FIRSTMISS_LEVEL(props) = dcache::DFML_MULTI;
 *	ws->require(dcache::CATEGORY_FEATURE, props);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * To use this module, pass it name to the @c otawa-config utility: otawa-config --libs dcache.
