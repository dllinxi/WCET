/**
 * @defgroup etime	Event Time Module
 * This module aims to make more generic how events (cache hits/misses, branch prediction, etc)
 * are processed to generate block time.
 *
 * The basic idea is that each analysis contributes to the WCET by defining the events
 * (changes of the execution time) applying to instruction or a block. As a result, these events
 * are hooked to the basic block they apply to and design (a) which instruction is concerned,
 * (b) which part of the instruction execution they apply to (memory access, stage, functional unit, etc)
 * and (c) how they contribute to the time.
 *
 * In addition, a event may a contribution to the constraints of the ILP system and may be asked
 * to provide a overestimation or an underestimation of their occurrence according to their
 * contribution (worst case time or best case time) to the WCET.
 *
 * From the events, several policies may be applied to compute the times, to select
 * the granularity and the precision of the computed time or to choose a way to split
 * the CFG into blocks.
