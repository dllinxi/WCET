[[http://www.otawa.fr|OTAWA]] is dedicated to the development and experimentation
of Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) computation methods. OTAWA is a framework
composed of a main library, //libotawa//, with several sub-libraries and plugins
that may be automatically invoked by //libotawa//. This makes the framework
very versatile and easy to extend.

The goal of this manual is mainly to describe how extensions can be developed
for OTAWA.  The following extensions are described :
  * // scripts//: to provide a new computation methods or adaptation to new micro-architectures (usually matching a specific microprocessor model).
  * //loaders//: to adapt a new Instruction Set Architecture (ISA),
  * //analyzers// (or code processor in OTAWA terminology): to provide new or more specific analyzes, 
  * //ilp solvers//: to connect OTAWA with a new solver,

Before reading this manual, it is advised to master the OTAWA framework
whose details are given in the [[../manua/manual.html|OTAWA manual]]. It is also
a good idea to have an access to the API documentation (also called autodoc):
prefer the up-to-date auto-documentation delivered with your OTAWA package
although this documentation may be also obtained from [[http://www.otawa.fr/doku/autodoc|here]].

For any problem or question, you may ask the OTAWA developers from the site [[http://www.otawa.fr]].
