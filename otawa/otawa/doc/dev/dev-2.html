<h2><a name="3"></a>3 Analyzer Development  </h2>
<p>
OTAWA annotation system, loader plugins and scripts provides lots of possibilities to tune and customize the WCET computation. Yet, sometimes, the available analysis are not enough to support a particular hardware or application. Fortunately, OTAWA allows also to extend the performed analyzes  using its flexible plugin system. </p>
<h2><a name="3.1"></a>3.1 OTAWA Plugin System  </h2>
<p>
OTAWA is heavily built upon the plugin concept to make it as versatile as possible. This involves several issues for which OTAWA framework proposes several solutions. </p>
<p>
The first one is the localization of a needed plugin: OTAWA uses a system that try to locate a plugin based on the full name of used object. This approach can be applied to locate a plugin containing either a property identifier, a feature or a code processor. </p>
<p>
The full-qualified name is the complete name of the entity prefixed by the C++ name spaces (separated by the usual C++ "::"). The name spaces chain is transformed in a file system path that allows to lookout for a plugin containing it. Once the plugin is found in the file system, it is loaded and the looked item (property, feature and processor) becomes available. </p>
<p>
For example, the "otawa::dcache::MUST_ACS" property identifier produces the file system path "otawa/dcache". The, OTAWA will look for plugin matching this name in the usual directories where plugins are fetched: </p>
<ul >
<li><p>
 $PWD/.otawa/proc, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 $HOME/.otawa/proc </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 $(OTAWA_HOME)/lib/otawa/proc </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In fact, a hierarchical search is performed. First, only "otawa" is looked for a plugin. If not found, a plugin whose path "otawa/dcache" is looked. The search continues until the name space identifiers have been exhausted. This allows to group together in a same plugin different namespaces. </p>
<h2><a name="3.2"></a>3.2 Using Entities defined in a Plugin  </h2>
<p>
To get an entity inside a plugin (property identifier, feature or code processor), the full-qualified name is only required and lookup of this name is performed by OTAWA. To help the programmer in this task, the framework propose several useful class. </p>
<p>
For a property identifier, the class <tt>DynIdentifier</tt> is a good candidate. It takes as constructor argument the full-qualified name of the identifier and, as soon it is used, will automatically, if required, causes the linkage of the plugin. In addition, it may be used as any other identifier. The example below shows its use: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
#include &lt;otawa/prop/DynIdentifier.h&gt;
using namespace otawa;

static DynIdentifier INITIAL_SP("otawa::dcache::INITIAL_SP");

PropList props;
INITIAL_SP(props) = initial_sp_address;</pre></div><p>
The same exists for feature with <tt>DynFeature</tt> class: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
#include &lt;otawa/proc/DynFeature.h&gt;
using namespace otawa;

static DynFeature MAY_ACS_FEATURE("otawa::dcache::MAY_ACS_FEATURE");

WorkSpace *ws;
ws-&gt;require(MAY_ACS_FEATURE);</pre></div><p>
And it works in the same way for code processors with class <tt>DynProcessor</tt>. Naturally, this works only with registered processors.  </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
#include &lt;otawa/proc/DynProcessor.h&gt;
using namespace otawa;

static DynProcessor clp_builder("otawa::dcache::CLPBlockBuilder");
clp_builder.process(workspace, props);</pre></div><p>
It must be noted that global variable is an efficient to use dynamic identifier, dynamic feature or dynamic processors because the linkage is only performed once. </p>
<p>
Yet, the linkage to a dynamic entities, based on plugins, does not always succeed. In this case, an exception of class <tt>ProcessorNotFound</tt> or <tt>FeatureNotFound</tt> is raised. It may just be ignored and application will stop and display the message attached to the exception, letting the user understanding the problem: <tt>app::Application</tt> will do this automatically. Else the exception may be caught and a fix operation started. There is no exception for property identifier because they are supposed to be used after the requirement of their matching feature. </p>
<p>
The use of the <tt>static</tt> C++ modified aims to avoid symbols conflicts. Depending on the OS, this may prevent the linkage because a symbol of the same name is present. In addition, if the symbols have different types (and in our examples, they have), this could drive to the application crash. </p>
<h2><a name="3.3"></a>3.3 Writing a Analysis Plugin  </h2>
<p>
With the <tt>Dyn</tt><i>XXX</i> family of classe, it is possible to exploit entities defined in plugins. Here is presented the way to write and to make such a plugin. </p>
<p>
Let's for example, a wonderful analysis that counts the number of instructions in each basic block. It is in the <tt>useful</tt> package that defines several plugins and particularly the <tt>stat</tt> plugin. This plugin provides a feature, <tt>COUNT_FEATURE</tt> and a property <tt>INST_COUNT</tt>. It is implemented by the code processor <tt>InstCounter</tt>. </p>
<p>
First, a <tt>stat.h</tt> file has to be created containing this definitions in the right namespace to provides identifier and featiures to the user of the plugin: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
namespace useful { namespace stat {
	extern p::feature COUNT_FEATURE;
	extern Identifier&lt;int&gt; INST_COUNT;
} }</pre></div><p>
The code processor, <tt>InstCounter</tt>, does not need to be provided in the <tt>stat.h</tt> because it does not aim to be used as class but only as the producer of <tt>COUNT_FEATURE</tt>. Therefore, the source <tt>stat.cpp</tt> might looks like: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
#include "stat.h"

namespace useful { namespace stat {

class InstCounter: public BBProcessor {
public:
	p::declare reg;
	InstCounter(p::declare&amp; r = reg): BBProcessor(r) { }
protected:
	virtual void processBB(WorkSpace *ws, CFG *cfg, BasicBlock *bb) { ... }
};

p::declare InstCounter::reg = p::init("useful::stat::InstCounter", Version(1, 0, 0))
	.base(BBProcessor::reg)
	.maker&lt;InstCounter&gt;()
	.provide(COUNT_FEATURE);

p::Identifier&lt;int&gt; INST_COUNT("useful::stat::INST_COUNT", -1);
p::feature COUNT_FEATURE("useful::stat::COUNT_FEATURE", new Maker&lt;InstCounter&gt;());

} }		// useful::stat</pre></div><p>
The code of the plugin is mostly ready. Only an object declaring the OTAWA plugin is missing. This object allows to OTAWA to know that this is, as expected, a real plugin and to avoid to perform an inconsistent link. </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
namespace useful { namespace stat {
	class Plugin: public ProcessorPlugin {
	public:
		typedef genstruct::Table&lt;AbstractRegistration * &gt; procs_t;
		AbstractRegistration *regs[] = { InstCounter::reg };	// (1)	
		procs_t reg_tab(regs, 1);								// (2)
		 
	Plugin(void)
		: ProcessorPlugin("useful::stat", Version(1, 0, 0), OTAWA_PROC_VERSION) { }	// (3)
	virtual procs_t&amp; processors(void) const
		{ return procs_t::EMPTY; };	// (4)
};

} } useful::stat

useful::stat::Plugin OTAWA_PROC_HOOK;						// (4)
useful::stat::Plugin&amp; useful_stat = OTAWA_PROC_HOOK;		// (5)</pre></div><p>
The code above class a plugin class decicated to the plugin that must inherit from class <tt>otawa::ProcessorPlugin</tt>. At mark (1), a simple array with the registration of all provided code processors is created and then wrapped, mark (2), in a <tt>elm::genstruct::Table</tt>. This table is returned to the user with the virtual method <tt>ProcessorPlugin::processors</tt>. </p>
<p>
More interesting is the construction at mark (3). Arguments includes the plugin name, version and the version of the interface, constant <tt>OTAWA_PROC_VERSION</tt>. This content allows (a) to record the current version of plugin interface and (b) to allow to check compatibility when the plugin is load. </p>
<p>
Finally, out of the namespace of the name space of the plugin, a plugin instance must be created. It is named according to the constant <tt>OTAWA_PROC_HOOK</tt> that contains the real name used by OTAWA to lookup for the plugin entry. This definition must in the top name space else the C++ mangling will prevent OTAWA from finding it. In the opposite, the mark (5) is optional and only useful if static linkage is planned for this plugin. </p>
<p>
There are different ways to build a plugin but here is presented an approach based on <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> that works on the OS we support (Linux, Windows, MaxOSX)<a class="footnumber" href="#footnote-1">1</a></p>
<p>
To compile the plugin, the <i>CMake</i> script below may be used: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.6)

# configuration (1)
set(PLUGIN		"stat")			# plugin name
set(NAMESPACE	"useful")		# namespace
set(MODULES				)		# used modules (to pass to otawa-config=
set(SOURCES 	stat.cpp)		# sources of the plugin

# script (2)
project(${PLUGIN})

# look for OTAWA (3)
if(NOT OTAWA_CONFIG)
	find_program(OTAWA_CONFIG otawa-config DOC "path to otawa-config")
	if(NOT OTAWA_CONFIG)
		message(FATAL_ERROR "ERROR: otawa-config is required !")
	endif()
endif()
message(STATUS "otawa-config at ${OTAWA_CONFIG}")
execute_process(COMMAND "${OTAWA_CONFIG}" --cflags ${MODULES} OUTPUT_VARIABLE OTAWA_CFLAGS OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
execute_process(COMMAND "${OTAWA_CONFIG}" --libs ${MODULES}  OUTPUT_VARIABLE OTAWA_LDFLAGS OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)
execute_process(COMMAND "${OTAWA_CONFIG}" --prefix OUTPUT_VARIABLE OTAWA_PREFIX OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)

# plugin definition (4)
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "\\$ORIGIN/../../../")
include_directories("${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}" ".")
add_library(${PLUGIN} SHARED ${SOURCES})
set_property(TARGET ${PLUGIN} PROPERTY PREFIX "")
set_property(TARGET ${PLUGIN} PROPERTY COMPILE_FLAGS "${OTAWA_CFLAGS}")
target_link_libraries(${PLUGIN} "${OTAWA_LDFLAGS}")

# installation (5)
if(NOT PREFIX)
	set(PREFIX "${OTAWA_PREFIX}")
endif()
set(PLUGIN_PATH "${PREFIX}/lib/otawa/proc/${NAMESPACE}")
if(WIN32 OR WIN64)
	install(TARGETS ${PLUGIN} RUNTIME DESTINATION ${PLUGIN_PATH})
else()
	install(TARGETS ${PLUGIN} LIBRARY DESTINATION ${PLUGIN_PATH})
endif()</pre></div><p>
Section (1) only defines some variables that will be used thereafter while section (2) defines the projet for <i>CMake</i>. Section (3) looks for <tt>otawa-config</tt> to get details for compilation (<tt>OTAWA_CFLAGS</tt>, <tt>OTAWA_LDFLAGS</tt>). <tt>otawa-config</tt> is either automatically discovered if it is on the path, or may be passed as a parameter to the script as <tt>-DOTAWA_CONFIG=path-to-otawa-config</tt>. </p>
<p>
The section (4) is specially interesting as it builds the plugin itself. The <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH</tt> allows to link back with OTAWA libraries. <tt>$ORIGIN</tt> represents the container directory of the plugin and, as it may be have installed in the OTAWA standard directories <tt>lib/otawa/proc</tt>, the built path designs the directory <tt>lib</tt> where OTAWA libraries can be find. The number of <tt>..</tt> mus be adjusted according to the depth of <tt>${NAMESPACE}</tt> of the plugin. One must also observe that the library prefix, usually <tt>lib</tt>, is removed from the name of plugin. </p>
<p>
The installation is performed in section (5). It is not very clear but it seems that, on Windows, the plugin must be installed as a <tt>RUNTIME</tt> and not as a <tt>LIBRARY</tt>. </p>
<p>
The script has to be recorded as <tt>CMakeList.txt</tt> and can be invoked with: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
$ cmake .
$ make install</pre></div><h2><a name="3.4"></a>3.4 Management of Dependencies with Plugin  </h2>
<p>
Although the plugin techniques are widely used, their support in OS is quite irregular. This makes the procedure to build them and load them difficult to handle and specially for the developer. Using <tt>${CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH}</tt> as in the <i>CMake</i> of previous section is very efficient on Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOSX) but does not work on Windows. </p>
<p>
To help a bit, OTAWA supports meta-information with the its plugins. This meta-information is a file with the same named as the plugin but with <tt>.eld</tt> suffix and is formatted as Windows initialization files. It may help to pre-load required libraries and plugins, to mimic symbolic links of Unices, etc. </p>
<p>
In <tt>.eld</tt>, OTAWA is only interested in the section named <tt>elm-plugin</tt>. Developers can add other sections for their own use since they will be ignored by OTAWA. In this section, the following definitions are considered: </p>
<ul >
<li><p>
 <tt>author</tt> &#8211; author of the plugin in the form "AUTHOR &lt;EMAIL&gt;", </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>copyright</tt> &#8211; name and, optionally and space separated, link to the license, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>deps</tt> &#8211; ";" separated list of plugin names to load before the current plugin, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>description</tt> &#8211; description of the plugin for human user, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>libs</tt> &#8211; ";" separated list of library names or paths (absolute or relative) to load before the current plugin, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>name</tt> &#8211; alternative name of the plugin, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>path</tt> &#8211; absolute or relative path to the actual plugin (support for aliasing), </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>rpaths</tt> &#8211; ";" separated list of paths to look for required plugins / libraries, </p>
</li>
<li><p>
 <tt>site</tt> &#8211; URL to the website publising the plugin. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lets the example of the previous to depend on plugin <tt>useful::handy</tt>, the following <tt>stat.eld</tt> file can be created: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
[elm-plugin]
author=myself
deps=handy</pre></div><p>
To create an alias name to <tt>useful::stat</tt> named <tt>useful::old_stat</tt>, the file <tt>old_state.eld</tt> below must be generated: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
[elm-plugin]
name=stat
path=stat</pre></div><p>
Both files must be copied in the same directory as the plugin. This is done by the <i>CMake</i> below: </p>
<div class="listing"><pre class="code">
install(FILES stat.eld old_stat.eld DESTINATION ${PLUGIN_PATH})</pre></div><div class="footnotes">
<p class="footnote">
<a class="footnumber" name="footnote-1">1</a> On Windows, <a href="http://mingw.org/">MinGW</a> has been used) without changing the scripts. </p>
