/**
 * @defgroup sem Semantic Instructions
 *
 * OTAWA provides an abstraction layer between the actual binary program and static analyses.
 * This abstraction is composed of generic information about the processed instruction:
 * type of instruction, target for branch instruction, read and writtent registers, and so on.
 *
 * To perform value or interval analysis, we need to understand the processing of instructions.
 * To maintain this abstraction layer, OTAWA provides with some architecture plugins a way
 * to translate instruction into a list of architecture-independent instructions to let
 * value analyses to be independent of the actual architecture.
 *
 * @section sem-set Semantics Instruction Set
 *
 * Designing a language to describe any instruction set is may an impossible task.
 * In the opposite, our semantics language has for goal to allow to perform analyses
 * while retaining only important things for such a task: basic arithmetics and comparison
 * for integer and address and integer computation, minimal flow of control to allow
 * fast analysis.
 *
 * Basically, a machine instruction I is translated into a block of n semantic instructions [i0, i1, i2, ..., in-1].
 * To interpret a semantic block, one has to consider a semantic instruction counter, p. At beginning
 * of the interpretation, p = 0. According to the interpreted instructions, p is simply incremented (+1)
 * to perform sequential execution, or changed by adding a positive quantity n to avoid executing some instructions.
 * Notice that n >= 0 induces that no loop can appear in the interpretation of semantic block and hence no fix point
 * is required. The execution stops as soon as p >= n.
 *
 * A interpretation of a semantic i, |[i]|, can be viewed as a function taking as input (p, s) with s the
 * state of the program and producing a new (p', s'):
 *
 * |[i]|: (p, s) -> (p', s')
 *
 * The state s is a an instance of possible states, that is, of functions mapping registers R, temporaries T
 * and memory addresses A to a value in domain V:
 *
 * S: R U T U A -> V
 *
 * Set of registers depends on the underlying architecture but is mapped to IN. Temporaries are a subset of negative
 * integers but A currently represents address on 32-bits. For the remaining of the document, s[i] represents
 * the value of V in the state s that matches i, that may be a register, a temporary or an address. s[x / y]
 * represents a new state where value of y is x, that is, s' = s[x / y] = lambda i. if i = y then x else s[i].
 *
 * The algorithm to interpret a semantic block follows (s0 is the initial state):
 * @code
 *	p <- 0
 *	s <- s0
 *	WHILE i < n DO
 *		(p, s) <- |[ip]| (p, s)
 * @endcode
 *
 * The following sections describes the semantics of each instruction.
 *
 *
 * @section sem-set-comp Computation Instructions
 *
 * Basically, our semantic instructions have three operands and works with registers.
 * The first operand d is the target registers to store the result and next ones represents source operands (a and b).
 * The following arithmetics operations exists:
 * @li ADD -- addition,
 * @li SUB -- subtraction,
 * @li SHL -- logical shift left,
 * @li SHR -- logical shift right,
 * @li ASR -- arithmetic shift right,
 * @li AND -- binary and,
 * @li OR -- binary inclusive or,
 * @li XOR -- binary inclusive xor,
 * @li MUL -- signed multiplication,
 * @li MULU -- unsigned multiplication,
 * @li MULH -- higher order bits of multiplication,
 * @li DIV -- signed division,
 * @li DIVU -- unsigned division,
 * @li MOD -- signed integer division remainder,
 * @li MODU -- unsigned integer division remainder.
 *
 * The following instructions represents unary operations applied on the a register and stores
 * the result on the d register.
 * @li NEG -- sign negation,
 * @li NOT -- binary complement.
 *
 * Below is given the semantics of each instruction where:
 * @li a, b, c represents registers,
 * @li i represents 32-bits immediate value,
 * @li operators applies on unsigned values except if they are followed by "+".
 *
 * @code
 * |[add (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] +   s[b] / d])
 * |[sub (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] -   s[b] / d])
 * |[shl (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] <<  s[b] / d])
 * |[shr (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] >>  s[b] / d])
 * |[asr (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] >>+ s[b] / d])
 * |[and (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] &   s[b] / d])
 * |[or  (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] |   s[b] / d])
 * |[xor (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] ^   s[b] / d])
 * |[mul (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] *   s[b] / d])
 * |[mulu(d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] *+  s[b] / d])
 * |[mulh(d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[(s[a] *  s[b]) >> bitlength(d) / d])
 * |[div (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] /   s[b] / d])
 * |[divu(d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] /+  s[b] / d])
 * |[mod (d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] %   s[b] / d])
 * |[modu(d, a, b)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] %+  s[b] / d])
 * |[neg (d, a)   ]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[-s[a]         / d])
 * |[not (d, a)   ]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[~s[a]         / d])
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section sem-set Set Instructions
 *
 * There are four set instructions:
 * @li to transfer content of a register to another one, @p set,
 * @li to get a constant 32-bits value in a register, @p seti,
 * @li to assign undefined T value to a register, @p scratch,
 * @li to set the page of an address for multi-address space architectures, @p setp (very rarely used).
 *
 * Their semantics is described below (i is a 32-bits value):
 *
 * @code
 * |[set    (d, a)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] / d])
 * |[seti   (d, i)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[i / d])
 * |[scratch(d)   ]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[T / d])
 * |[setp   (d, i)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[p :: s[d] / d])
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section sem-flow Flow Instructions
 *
 * In semantic instructions, there are two types of control flow: machine flow corresponds to PC assignment
 * in the underlying instruction set and is supported by CFG; semantic flow that controls the execution
 * flow of semantic instruction. The only instruction concerning the machine control flow is @p branch
 * that gives the new address stored in the PC but it doesn't change the semantic instruction counter p.
 *
 * The semantic control flow is handled by two instruction, @p cont that stops the execution and @p if
 * that makes following instructions optional. The condition used in @p if is generated from
 * a comparison result, a ~ b (a compared to b), generated by either a @p cmp instruction, or @cmpu instruction.
 * Then the @p if statement exploits the comparison results to apply one of the following condition:
 * @li EQ -- a == b
 * @li LT -- a < b
 * @li LE -- a <= b
 * @li GE -- a >= b
 * @li GT -- a > b
 * @li NE -- a != b
 * @li ANY_COND -- do not know anything (recall we are performing static analysis).
 * @li ULT -- a < b
 * @li ULE -- a <= b
 * @li UGE -- a >= b
 * @li UGT -- a > b
 *
 * Below is the semantics of the flow instructions (c is a condition and c[a] returns true
 * if condition c is satisfied in register a):
 *
 * @code
 * |[branch(a)       ]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s)		// PC <- s[a]
 * |[cmp   (d, a, b) ]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] ~+ s[b] / d])
 * |[cmpu  (d, a, b) ]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s[a] ~  s[b] / d])
 * |[cont            ]| (p, s) = (n, s)
 * |[if    (c, a, k) ]| (p, s) = (if c[a] then p + 1 else p + k, s)
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section sem-mem Memory Access Instruction
 *
 * There are only two instructions used to perform memory access:
 * @li @p load allows to get a value from memory using its address and its type,
 * @li @p store allows to store a register value to a memory address using the given type.
 *
 * Notice that the types are required to realize the bytes modified in memory
 * and to generate correct value in register (including sign extension). The types may be one of:
 * @li int8 -- signed integer on 8-bits,
 * @li int16 -- signed integer on 16-bits,
 * @li int32 -- signed integer on 32-bits,
 * @li int64 -- signed integer on 64-bits,
 * @li uint8 -- unsigned integer on 8-bits,
 * @li uint16 -- unsigned integer on 16-bits,
 * @li uint32 -- unsigned integer on 32-bits,
 * @li uint64 -- unsigned integer on 64-bits.
 *
 * The semantics of these instructions follows (t is the type, s(t) represents access to state with type t):
 * @code
 * |[load (d, a, t)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s[s(t)[s[a] / d])
 * |[store(d, a, t)]| (p, s) = (p + 1, s(t)[d / s[b]])
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section sem-spec Special Instruction
 *
 * There is also a @spec semantics instruction kind that must be used by
 * instruction effects not tractable with the current semantics instruction set.
 * One using the SPEC instructions must be aware that standard usual analyses
 * will not cope with such instructions: they will need to be customized.
 * Therefore, the semantics of @p spec is undefined.
 *
 *
 * @section sem-reg Register and Temporaries
 *
 * Operators used in the instruction (a, b and d) represents unique representation
 * of registers (as returned by Register::platformNumber()) for positive number or
 * temporaries when negative numbers are used.
 *
 * Temporary values are useful when
 * the semantics expression of an instruction is complex and requires several
 * temporary results. To alleviate the management of temporaries, they are easy
 * identified as they are represented as negative numbers and their maximum number
 * is provided by the @ref Process::tempMax(). Please, notice that the liveness
 * of a temporary must not expand out of the semantics block of an instruction !
 *
 *
 * @section sem-anal Building Analyses
 *
 * Static analyses using instruction semantics are usually called data-flow
 * analysis. Using Abstact Interpretation, the interpretation domain is
 * usually an abstraction of the program variables state. The state includes
 * usually the value of the registers (simply identified by the register platform
 * number) and the addresses of used locations in memory. Register numbers
 * and memory location addresses grouped together forms the address set.
 *
 * So, the state becomes usually maps from addresses to value. OTAWA provides
 * already several representations for these maps.The next step is to define
 * the abstraction of the values: values are stored in registers and in memory
 * and must be specialized according to the performed analysis. For example,
 * the CLP (Cycle Linear Progression) analysis, the values are represented
 * as triplets (b, d, n) representing a set of integers (and adresses) from
 * the set {b + i d / 0 <= i < n}. But, it may be any value you want, adapted
 * to your analysis. Whatever, one must remark that addresses are usually
 * storable in registers and in memory, the value set must provides a way
 * to represent them.
 *
 * The usual map representations provide already functions to perform
 * abstract interpretation (bottom value, initial value, update, join, etc).
 * In the case of the value, you have also to provide function to perform
 * abstract interpretation but also functions to interpret the different
 * semantic instructions.
 *
 * To help the developer supports the multiple execution
 * path of a semantic bloc, one can use the class @ref otawa::sem::PathIter that
 * works like a usual iterator but provides also indications of the executed
 * paths and instructions:
 * @li op, d, a, b, cst, reg, addr -- access to instruction description,
 * @li pathEnd() -- true if execution is at end,
 * @li isCond() -- true if the current instruction is a @p if, meaning that two paths will start from this point.
 *
 * A common way to use @ref otawa::sem::PathIter is to maintain a stack of states where the current state
 * is pushed when an @p if is found and a state is popped when an execution path ends. The different states
 * obtained at each end of an execution path can be joined:
 * @code
 * 	genstruct::Vector<State> stack;
 * 	State s = initial_state, result = bottom_state;
 * 	stack.push(s);
 * 	for(sem::PathIter i(machine_instruction); i; i++) {
 * 		if(i.pathEnd()) {
 * 			result = join(result, s);
 * 			s = stack.pop();
 * 		}
 * 		else {
 * 			if(i.isCond())
 *				stack.push(s);
 *			s = apply(i, s);
 * 		}
 * 	}
 * 	return result;
 * @endcode
 *
 * A specific processing is devoted to SPEC instructions. A convenient analysis
 * must let its user to specialize it in order to support these instructions.
 * To achieve this goal, it must provide in the analysis a virtual function
 * that is called each time the SPEC instruction is interpreted. It would be
 * useful if this function takes as parameter the real instruction, the
 * semantics instruction and the current abstract state. In the initial analysis,
 * this function simply do nothing but it lets customizer to overload it
 * in order to customize the interpretation.
