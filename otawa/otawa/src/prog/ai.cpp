/**
 * @defgroup ai		New Abstract Interpretation Engine
 *
 * This module defines a set of classes to perform abstract interpretation.
 * It is most versatile as the previous module, HalfAbsInt, and should be used
 * to perform now in OTAWA to perform analyzes.
 *
 * @section ai-principles Principles
 *
 * The support for abstract interpretation is made of different classes that
 * are able to interact together according the needs of the developer.
 * Basically, there are three types of classes:
 * @li drivers -- implement the Iterator model, they implement the policy of calculation order (@ref WorkListDriver),
 * @li stores -- store and retrieve efficiently results of abstract interpretation (@ref ArrayStore, @ref EdgeStore),
 * @li adapters -- provide interface between program representation (as graphs) and other classes (@ref CFGGraph).
 *
 * Finally, the domains are given by the user and details the abstract interpretation to perform.
 *
 * @section ai-method Method
 *
 * First, according to the program representation, developer has to choose a graph adapter. There is only one now
 * (@ref CFGGraph) for a lonely CFG but more will be proposed in the near future.
 *
 * Second, the abstract interpretation domain has to be designed. It is class providing the following resources:
 * @li empty constructor (for extend freedom in implementation of stage),
 * @li t -- type of values in the abstract domain,
 * @li init() -- return the initial state (at entry node of the graph),
 * @li join() -- join of two values of the abstract domain.
 *
 * Update functions are not included in this list because they depend only on the way driver is used.
 *
 * Then the storage and the driver must be chosen and tied together as below. This approach allows to customize
 * the way the computation is performed. In the example below, we just apply the same method whatever the node
 * or the edge.
 *
 * @code
 *  MyDomain dom;
 * 	CFGGraph graph(cfg);
 * 	ArrayStore<MyDomain, CFGraph> store;
 *  WorkListDriver<MyDomain, CFGGraph, ArrayStore<MyDomain, CFGraph> > driver(dom, graph store);
 *  while(driver)
 *  	driver.check(dom.update(*driver, driver.input()));
 * @endcode
