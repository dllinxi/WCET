/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * OTAWA (http://www.otawa.fr) is a C++ framework dedicated to static analysis of program in machine language form
 * and more specifically oriented towards WCET (Worst Case Executime Time) computation.
 * This pages represents the automatic documentation of the API of OTAWA
 * (automatically extracted from sources) and is devoted to the OTAWA developer
 * or to the command line user. If your goal is only to compute WCET from the Eclipse environment,
 * refer instead to the OTAWA Eclipse plugin manual.
 *
 * @section reading Reading this Document
 *
 * This document contains the automatic documentation of classes composing OTAWA, that is
 * several tenth of classes. Hence, reading documentation of each in turn is definitively the
 * preferred way to use it. If your goal is to learn programming OTAWA, take first a look
 * to the OTAWA Manual available in OTAWA_HOME/share/Otawa/doc/manual/manual.html.
 * If you aim to extend your knowledge of OTAWA classes or to look for an available facility,
 * continue your reading.
 *
 * This document is automatically generated from the automatic documentation of OTAWA classes
 * by the Doxygen utility. This means that all classes, types, functions are documented
 * and may be easily retrieved. For OTAWA concepts, like code processor, identifier and features,
 * you have to fetch the module documentation whose the outline is given below.
 *
 * If you look for an existing analysis, the good entry point should be the list of features,
 * @ref features. For other facilities, consult the module list in the left sub-frame.
 * In addition, below is a list of standard plugin of OTAWA. To get documentation of a specific
 * class, we advise to use the alphabetic of classes from the menu Classes > Class Index.
 *
 *
 * @section content Content
 *
 * OTAWA is logically split in different module representing different layers and usage of the
 * framework. In the following, you will find a guide to explore theses modules. Notice that
 * the OTAWA module splitting is not ever reflected by the header files and the libraries,
 * specially the kernel module of OTAWA.
 *
 * OTAWA is logically split in different layer matching module:
 * @li @ref prog -- the main module and the root any work in OTAWA provides the abstract
 * representation of the program to handle.
 * @li @ref prop -- the property layer is built just above the program representation
 * to link properties or annotation to the program representation.
 * @li @ref proc -- this layer allows to make automatic the chaining and dependency
 * solving of analyses.
 * @li @ref hard -- this layer provides the description of the host platform where
 * the loaded program will run.
 * @li @ref dfa -- module devoted to generic classes to perform static analyses.
 * @li @ref ipet -- module containing class to implements the WCET computation by IPET.
 * @li @ref ff -- module providing support for flow fact information provided by user
 * or external tool.
 * @li @ref graph -- module providing classes to handle graphs.
 * @li @ref display -- module providing facilities to display graphs.
 * @li @ref application -- module helping to write command line applications.
 *
 * In addition, some utilities are provided:
 * @li @ref dumpcfg -- outputs CFG with different format (textual, .dot).
 * @li @ref odfa -- performs and outputs data flow analysis.
 * @li @ref odisasm -- disassembling of the program in machine code and in semantic instructions.
 * @li @ref oipet -- computes WCET according to different alternativs of the IPET approach.
 * @li @ref opcg -- outputs the Program Call Graph (PCG).
 * @li @ref ostat -- computes some statistics about instructions of a program.
 * @li @ref owcet -- computes the WCET based on the scripts.
 *
 * To extend OTAWA facilities, some analyzes are packaged in plugins.
 * Some plugins are devoted to load and to decode binaries:
 * @li arm2 -- loader for ARM v5 (+ thumb) instruction set.
 * @li ppc2 -- loader for PowerPC (including VLE extension) instruction set.
 *
 * Other plugins allows to plug ILP solver:
 * @li lp_solve5 -- lp_solve library.
 *
 * Finally, some provide specific analyzes:
 * @li ast (@ref ast) -- provide program representation as Abstract Syntactic Trees.
 * @li bpred (@ref bpred) -- branch prediction based on state graphs.
 * @li cat (@ref cat) -- LRU instuction cache analysis by categorisation.
 * @li ccg (@ref ccg) -- direct-mapped instruction cache analysis based on state graphs.
 * @li cfgio (@ref cfgio) -- input/output of CFGs.
 * @li dcache (@ref dcache) -- basic LRU data cache analysis.
 * @li etime (@ref etime) -- time determination by block based on parametric execution graph by time set split.
 * @li ets (@ref ets) -- very basic implementation of Extended Timing Schema.
 * @li display (@ref display) -- various display facilities for CFG.
 *
 *
 * @section howto How to read the API ?
 *
 * @subsection howto-struct Structure of OTAWA
 *
 * Built over the C++ class abstraction, OTAWA proposes a layer taking into account the iterative
 * process of analyzing the programs in machine code. Basically, the program is expressed
 * in a form independent of the actual micro-architecture and ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
 * settled on the classes @ref Process, @ref File, @ref Segment and @ref Inst.
 *
 * Each of these objects supports annotations. In OTAWA, an annotation is a piece of information
 * referred and typed by an Identifier and linked to a so-called property list, that is, most
 * of objects of the OTAWA program representation. For example, instructions receiving a label
 * get a @ref otawa::LABEL annotation that associates the string naming the label.
 *
 * As long as static analyzes are performed on the program, more and more annotations are
 * tied the program representation creating two issues: (a) how to chain the analyzes to
 * maintain the soundness of the results and (b) how to cope with the chaos caused
 * by availability of the different annotations in the analysis implementation.
 * The implemented solution proposes to group logically annotations together
 * in the so-called @i features. For example, the @ref otawa::LOOP_INFO_FEATURE
 * group together the annotations for identifying loop heads, the exiting edges and
 * the parent loops in the CFG.
 *
 * Finally, the analyzes are packaged in a so-called @i code @i processor
 * (because they not only perform analyzes but they are able to also changes
 * the program representation). Each code processor applies on the program representation
 * using the annotations provided by other code processor but also generates new annotations
 * that will be useful for the following analyzes. Projected to the domain features,
 * each code processor requires a set of feature before its execution and provide
 * a new set of feature.  Notice that most feature are associated with a code processor
 * and, hence, the requirement of a code processor may causes the automatic execution
 * of the default code processor of the feature. This system ensures that all require
 * information is provided when a code processor starts its analysis.
 *
 * For example, the @ref otawa::LOOP_INFO_FEATURE is implemnented, as a default, by
 * the @ref otawa::LoopInfoBuilder. This one requires, to be started, that the features
 * @ref otawa::DOMINANCE_FEATURE and @ref otawa::INVOLVED_CFG_FEATURE to be available.
 * If they are not, their own default code processor will be automatically called.
 *
 * As a consequence, annotation identifiers, feature and code processor have a specific
 * documentation format described here.
 *
 * @subsection howto-id Annotation Identifier Documentation
 * The identifier are used to type and name the annotation put in the property lists,
 * that is, the object representing a program representation. Their documentation follows
 * the example below:
 *
 * @htmlonly
 * <div style="background-color: #FFEB76; display: block; border-style:solid; border-width:1px; padding: 4px; ">
 * <pre>Identifier<BasicBlock*> otawa::ENCLOSING_LOOP_HEADER("otawa::ENCLOSING_LOOP_HEADER", 0)</pre>
 * <p>Defined for any BasicBlock that is part of a loop.
 * Contains the header of the loop immediately containing the basicblock If the basicblock is a loop header, then, the property contains the header of the parent loop.</p>
 * <h3>Hooks</h3>
 * <ul><li>BasicBlock</li></ul>
 *
 * <h3>Feature</h3>
 * <ul><li>otawa::LOOP_INFO_FEATURE</li></ul>
 * </div>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * The first line gives the C++ description of the identifier defining its name, the type of the tied data
 * and its default value (0 here). The two following gives the meaning of the identifier. The @c Hooks
 * gives the list of classes that may support this identifier, @ref otawa::BasicBlock in this case.
 * Finally, the @c Feature paragraph gives the list of feature this identifier belongs to. This last section
 * is optional for identifiers used configurations for a code processor.
 *
 * @subsection howto-feature Feature Documentation
 * A feature is a group of annotation identifier tied together around a shared topic.
 * It is documented is below:
 *
 * @htmlonly
 * <div style="background-color: #FFEB76; display: block; border-style:solid; border-width:1px; padding: 4px; ">
 * <pre>SilentFeature otawa::dcache::MUST_ACS_FEATURE("otawa::dcache::MUST_ACS_FEATURE", _maker)</pre>
 * <p>This feature ensures that the ACS (Abstract Cache State) for the MUST data cache analysis has been built.
 * Usually, the ACS are used to derivate the categories of each data cache access.</p>
 * <h3>Processors</h3>
 * <ul><li>ACSBuilder (default)</li></ul>
 * <h3>Properties</h3>
 * <ul><li>MUST_ACS</li></ul>
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 * <ul><li>ENTRY_MUST_ACS</li></ul>
 * </div>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * After a declaration line containing mainly the name of the feature, several sections give:
 * @li the code processors implementing the feature (and the default code processor),
 * @li the set of properties belonging to the feature (with link to get quickly their documentation),
 * @li the set of properties used as configuration for comuting the feature.
 *
 * @subsection howto-proc Code Processor Documentation
 * The code processors performs the analysis using available annotations (whose feature are required
 * by the processor) and provides new one (belonging to the provided features).
 *
 * @htmlonly
 * <div style="background-color: #FFEB76; display: block; border-style:solid; border-width:1px; padding: 4px; ">
 * <pre>otawa::dcache::ACSBuilder Class Reference</pre>
 * <p>...</p>
 * <p>This builder performs analysis of the L1 data cache and produces ACS for MUST and,
 * according to the configuration properties, persistence. As a result, it provides ACS.</p>
 * <h3>Provided features</h3>
 * <ul><li>MUST_ACS_FEATURE</li></ul>
 * <h3>Required features</h3>
 * <ul><li>LOOP_INFO_FEATURE</li>
 * <li>DATA_BLOCK_FEATURE</li></ul>
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 * <ul><li>DATA_FIRSTMISS_LEVEL</li>
 * <li>DATA_PSEUDO_UNROLLING</li></ul>
 * </div>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * After the code processor class definition and the definition of its members, a small text describes
 * the function and the algorithm of the code processor. Then several sections gives details about
 * the code processor:
 * @li the list of provided features,
 * @li the list of required features,
 * @li the list of configuration properties (i.e. annotations).
 *
 * @section develop-otawa Developing with OTAWA
 *
 * Whatever the type of program using OTAWA, the command @ref otawa-config is the right entry
 * point to obtain compilation flags, libraries to link with and installation information.
 * OTAWA is not focused on a particular building (autotools, CMake, etc) while it provides
 * the ability to call @ref otawa-config.
 *
 * @subsection developing-basic Basic Options
 *
 * See @ref application for helper classes to write command line applications.
 *
 * OTAWA provides an API in C++: to compile a C++ source, just use the @c --cflags option:
 * @code
 * otawa-config --cflags
 * @endcode
 *
 * To link your application, get the options with @c --libs:
 * @code
 * otawa-config --libs
 * @endcode
 *
 * To run the obtained program, ensure that the @c lib directory of OTAWA is found on the system.
 * For Unixes, add this directory to the @c $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it may be obtained by using
 * option @c --prefix and appending @c /lib. On Unixes supporting ELF format,
 * you may also use the @c --rpath option to get
 * this directory linked in the executable (on Unixes only):
 * @code
 * otawa-config --libs --rpath
 * @endcode
 *
 * On Windows OSes, such facilities do not exist: one solution is to add the OTAWA @c bin directory
 * to the @c @PATH@ system variable; another one is to copy your executable in the @c bin directory
 * of OTAWA.
 *
 * Whatever your compilation option, you may also obtain the installation directory of OTAWA
 * with @c --prefix option:
 * @code
 * otawa-config --prefix
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection develop-use-plugin Using a Plugin
 *
 * OTAWA framework is based on plugins. They are two ways to use identifier, features and processors
 * provided by a plugin: (a) using the DynXXX classes (@ref DynIdentifier, @ref DynFeature or
 * @ref DynProcessor) or (b) by linking dynamically with a plugin binary. The latter form is preferred
 * as soon as you have to use non-inlined method of classes provided by the plugin.
 *
 * To perform the linkage, @ref otawa-config may help also by adding to the command line the list
 * of required plugins (do not forget to give the whole path with components separated by slashes):
 * @code
 * otawa-config --libs path1/plugin1 path2/plugin2 ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * If the @c --rpath option is also given, the path of used plugins is appended to the
 * RPATH list of directories.
 *
 *
 * @subsection develop-write-plugin Plugin Writing
 *
 * Maybe, the more easy way to extend OTAWA is to write new analyzes and to package them
 * in a package and then to invoke analyzes from a script.
 *
 * To link the plugin, @ref otaw-config may help also either using the list of plugin,
 * or using the plugin description file @c .eld that contains a @c deps entry as in the example below
 * (file is named @c myplugin.elf ):
 * @code
 * [elm-plugin]
 * name=myplugin
 * deps=path1/plugin1;path2/plugin2;...
 * @endcode
 *
 * To get the right option for linking the plugin, this file may be used with @c -p option as below:
 * @code
 * otawa-config --libs -p myplugin.eld
 * @endcode
