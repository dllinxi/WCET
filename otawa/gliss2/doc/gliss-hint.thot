===== C Compilation Problem =====

==== Inlines ====

For sake of performances, @(GLISS) is using inlining of some low-level
functions. Although most of current C compiler supports the involved
''inline'' keywords, it may be not the case with yours. In this case,
just add the definition ''-DCOMPAT'' to the ''CFLAGS'' definition
of the generated ''Makefile'' to remove any use of inlined functions.
