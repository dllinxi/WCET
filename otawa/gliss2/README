====== GLISS v2 ======

GLISS is an ISS (Instruction Set Simulator). It takes as input a file
(or a collection of files) in SimNML (an ADL -- Architecture Description
Language) and produces a library containing modules to decode,
simulate and disassemble a binary program in the given instruction set.

GLISS v2 has the following dependencies:
  * OCAML [[http://ocaml.org/]],
  * Perl,
  * GNU Make.

The generated library sources are in C so a good C compiler is also
required.

To compile GLISS v2:
<code sh>
> cd gliss2
> make
</code>

Several instruction sets are already supported by GLISS v2:
  * PowerPC (ppc2)
  * ARM v5 (armv5t)
  * ARM v7 (armv7t)
  * Sparc (sparc)
  * TriCore (tricore)

To get such an instruction set and build the ISS library, take the identifier
in parenthesis, let be XXX, and type:
<code sh>
> cd ..
> hg clone https://wwwsecu.irit.fr/hg/TRACES/XXX/trunk XXX
> cd XXX
> make
</code>

Generation of code of most of them may be customized: just edit the file
''Makefile'' and the option are available at the head of the file.

GLISS v2 is delivered under GPL v3 license by the university of Toulouse.
