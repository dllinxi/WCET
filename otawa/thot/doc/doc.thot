@(THOT) is a simple but powerful system to authorize document. The main
idea is that classic document processor (like OpenOffice or M$ Office)
are usually too complex to really get productivity gains. The melting of
keyboard and mouse and other input devices use is too slow, too
cumbersome to let the user develop its imagination and its creativity.

In the opposite, some document generation systems like Latex or HTML
(DocBook, etc) makes the user free from complex devices (and let it
focus on the keyboard) but are usually hard to read: too much tags
lessen the readbility of the text.

Finally, the wiki tag system has shown to tie the lightness of keyboard
with the readibility of not obfuscating notation. Yet, there are a lot
of different wiki syntaxes and each people has its preferences.

The @(THOT) project was started from this statement to provide a tool that
allows:
  * to the select the wiki syntax you like,
  * to choose the output format,
  * to enrich the syntax with domain-dedicated languages.

In the first part of this document, you will find a tutorial to the
@(THOT) usage. In the second part, an exhaustive description of features
of @(THOT) is given and the last part is developper oriennted because
@(THOT) has been designed as main barebone supporting use extensions.
