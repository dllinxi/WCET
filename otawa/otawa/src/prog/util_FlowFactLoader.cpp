/**
 * @defgroup ff Flow Facts
 *
 * This module addresses the problem of the use of flow facts in OTAWA.
 * As this kind of information may be provided by the user or external tools,
 * OTAWA accepts several formats of input :
 * @li @ref f4 is a textual format with specific commands,
 * @li @ref ffx is an XML format.
 *
 * During the work of OTAWA, the load of this file is performed using a special
 * code processor: @ref otawa::util::FlowFactLoader.
 *
 * Flow facts are usually hooked as properties to the program part
 * they apply to. Below is the list of properties set as flow facts.
 * @li @ref ACCESS_RANGE
 * @li @ref BRANCH_TARGET
 * @li @ref CALL_TARGET
 * @li @ref IGNORE_CONTROL
 * @li @ref IGNORE_ENTRY
 * @li @ref IGNORE_SEQ

/**
 * @page ffx Flow Fact XML format
 * @ingroup ff
 *
 * The format FFX, usually with the extension @c{.ffx}, provide the expressivity
 * of XML applied to the expression of flow facts. The top level element must
 * be @c{flowfacts}:
 *
 * @code
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 * <flowfacts>
 *	...
 * </flowfacts>
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Addressing of program parts
 *
 * The different element of this XML flow fact description usually designs
 * some location in the program code. There are is different ways to describe
 * code locations (as shown below) and the syntax, based on attributes of the
 * elements, is shared by most flow fact elements.
 *
 * In the following location forms, the used integers may have the following
 * forms:
 * @li a decimal integer,
 * @li prefixed by '0', an octal integer,
 * @li prefixed by '0[xX]', an hexadecimal integer.
 *
 * @code
 * <element address="ADDRESS"/>
 * @endcode
 * This is the simplest way to design a code piece just by its address. This
 * address represents an integer coded as above. As this way is not very human
 * compliant, you may prefer one of the following form.
 *
 * @code
 * <element label="LABEL" offset="OFFSET"/>
 * @endcode
 * This form provide a bit more portability and usability as the previous one.
 * The address is represented as a label found in the code (usually a function
 * label) and a signed integer offset to add to or substract from the label address.
 * This location may be useful for symbol found in libraries. As the actual
 * address is not known before program linkage, the location may be used
 * and remains valid after linkage.
 *
 * @code
 * <element symbol="SYMBOL" size="SIZE"/>
 * @endcode
 * This form provides a way to define a memory area in a single step.
 * The defined memory area begins by the address of @c symbol and its size is
 * @c size of it is defined or the size of the @c symbol.
 *
 * @code
 * <element source="SOURCE_FILE" line="LINE"/>
 * @endcode
 * This is the most advanced to locate code using the source file name and
 * the line of the designed program part. Yet, according to the way the code
 * is written (many source constructor on one line or use of macros) and
 * to the performed optimization, this method may be imprecise as a	a source line
 * may match different parts in the code.
 *
 * In the remaining of the document, the location defines above are identified
 * by the keyword @c LOCATION in the element attributes.
 *
 * @par Top level elements
 *
 * Inside the @c flowfacts elements, the FFX format accepts the following
 * components.
 *
 * @code
 * <noreturn LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * This flow fact inform that the located function never return. This may be
 * helpful for function as the C library "_exit".
 *
 * @code
 * <nocall LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * When OTAWA encounters a call to the located function, it will be ignored.
 *
 * @code
 * <doinline LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * When virtualizing, calls to the located function will be inlined.
 *
 * @code
 * <noinline LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * When virtualizing, calls to the located function will not be inlined.
 *
 * @code
 * <inlining-on LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * When virtualizing the located function, default policy will be set to true.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>memory access INST_ADDRESS1 LOW_ADDRESS .. HIGH_ADDRESS [in STEP1 / STEP2 / ...] ;</tt></b> @n
 * Sets the memory accessed by the instruction at INST_ADDRESS
 * to the range from LOW_ADDRESS up to third HIGH_ADDRESS,
 * optionally in the given context.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>memory TYPE ADDRESS = VALUE ;</tt></b> @n
 * Sets the memory at ADDRESS to the VALUE of type TYPE.
 *
 * @code
 * <inlining-off LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * When virtualizing the located function, default policy will be set to false.
 *
 * @code
 * <function LOCATION>
 * 	CONTENT
 * </function>
 * @endcode
 * This flow fact informs that the CONTENT elements are applied to the
 * located function. This element is mainly used to build function call
 * contextual flow fact.
 *
 * @code
 * <loop LOCATION maxcount="INTEGER" totalcount="INTEGER"/>
 * @endcode
 * This element allows to put iteration limits on bounds. The LOCATION designs
 * the header of the loop. @c maxcount gives the maximal number of iteration
 * per loop start and @c totalcount gives the total number of loop iteration
 * for the whole program execution. At least one of them must be given.
 *
 * @code
 * <ignore-entry name="STRING"/>
 * @endcode
 * In some executable files, symbols are marked as function entries but are not,
 * possibly causing problems in instruction decoding. This problem may be avoided
 * by marking such symbols with this directive.
 *
 * @code
 * <return LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * The instruction at the given location is considered as a return. This element
 * may be useful with languages where control management and computation is melted.
 * For example, the ARM allows to store the return address of a function call out of
 * the usual link register and move of a register value in the PC may as well be
 * considered as an indirect call as a return.
 *
 * @par Content of functions and calls
 *
 * The @c function element content may be either @c loop elements as given
 * above or @c call  elements.
 *
 * @code
 * <call LOCATION>
 * 	 CONTENT
 * </call>
 * @endcode
 * This element represents a function call inside an existing function. The
 * LOCATION gives the address of the called function. The content is the same
 * as of a @c function, that is, @c loop and @c call elements. The embedding
 * of calls allows to build function call contexts to make the loop bounds
 * context aware and tighten the WCET.
 *
 * @code
 * <multibranch LOCATION>
 *   <target LOCATION />
 *   ...
 * </multibranch>
 * @endcode
 * This element is used to resolve a complex control to several targets
 * (case of indirect branch found in switch compilation using tables).
 * The first LOCATION is the control instruction itself and the target child
 * elements locations represents the different possible targets.
 *
 * @code
 * <multicall LOCATION>
 *   <target LOCATION />
 *   ...
 * </multicall>
 * @endcode
 * This element is used to resolve a complex control to several targets
 * (case of function pointer calls).
 * The first LOCATION is the call instruction itself and the target child
 * elements locations represents the different possible targets.
 *
 * @code
 * <ignorecontrol LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * This element is used to ignore the control effect of the instruction at LOCATION.
 *
 * @code
 * <ignoreseq LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * This element is used to force instruction at LOCATION to be considered
 * as an unconditional branch.
 * Can only be put on a conditional branch instruction.
 *
 * @par Extension
 *
 * Top-level element support also the following extension elements
 * (not included in the FFX format):
 *
 * @code
 * <mem-access LOCATION>
 * 		<low LOCATION />
 * 		<high LOCATION />
 * </mem-access>
 * @endcode
 * @code
 * <mem-access LOCATION>
 *  	<area LOCATION />
 *  	...
 * </mem-access>
 * @endcode
 * Allow to bound the accessed addresses of a memory instruction.
 * When multiple areas are defined, they are joined to a single continuous area!
 * Mainly useful to help data cache analysis.
 *
 * @code
 * <reg-set name="TEXT"> VALUE </reg-set>
 * @endcode
 * Set the value of a register. <i>name</i> is the name of the register.
 *
 * @code
 * <mem-set type="TEXT" LOCATION> VALUE </mem-set>
 * @endcode
 * Set the value of a kind of memory. The LOCATION attributes gives
 * the address of the accessed memory and <i>type</i> defines the type of data
 * among <b>int8</b>, <b>int16</b>, <b>int32</b>, <b>int64</b>, <b>uint8</b>, <b>uint16</b>,
 * <b>uint32</b> and <b>uint64</b>.
 *
 * <b><i>VALUE</i></b> may be one of:
 * @code
 * 	<value LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * Declare a simple integer value or an address.
 *
 * @code
 * 	<low LOCATION/>
 * 	<high LOCATION/>
 * @endcode
 * A range of integer or of addresses.
 * @code
 * 	<value LOCATION step="INTEGER" count="INTEGER"/>
 * @endcode
 * Declare a CLP (b, d, n) of base the location attributes, step and count
 * and denotes the set { b + k d / 0 <= j <= n }.

/**
 * @page f4 F4 : Flow Facts File Format
 * @ingroup ff
 *
 * This file format is used to store flow facts information, currently, the
 * loop bounds. The usual non-mandatory extension of F4 files is "ff".
 *
 * @par Lexical Level
 *
 * F4 is a simple plain text format. It may contain comments a-la C++, that is, one
 * line comments prefixed by "//" or enclosed comments between "/ *" and "* /"."
 * Spaces and line format are not meaningful for other commands.
 * In the following description, upper case words represents variable part
 * of the command, i.e. sub-rules of grammar. If such a token is prefixed
 * by a name followed by ":", this name is used to identify the token
 * in subsequent description.
 *
 * @par Directives
 *
 * @li <b><tt>loop ADDRESS COUNT ;</tt></b> @n
 * Declare that the loop whose header start at the
 * given address has the given maximal bound.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>loop ADDRESS ... in STEP1 / STEP2 / ...;</tt></b> @n
 * Same as above but limit the loop bound to the given calling context.
 * STEP1 is the address of the function calling the loop, STEP2 is the
 * address of the function calling the former one and so on. It is not
 * required to go back to the task entry point. In the latter case, the bound
 * will be applied to any call context whose prefix matches the given one.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>loop ADDRESS [max MAX] [total TOTAL] [in ...]</tt></b> @n
 * In addition to select the MAX number of iterations per startup of a loop,
 * this form of <b><tt>loop</tt></b> allows also to select the TOTAL number
 * of iterations for the whole task run.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>checksum VALUE ;</tt></b> @n
 * This command is used to check the consistency
 * between the flow fact file and the matching executable file (it is the
 * Fletcher checksum of the executable file).
 *
 * @li <b><tt>return ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * Mark a complex control instruction as equivallent to sub-program return.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>noreturn FUNCTION_ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * Mark the function as non-returning like the standard C library "exit".
 *
 * @li <b><tt>ignorecontrol ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * Force to ignore the control effect of the addressed instruction.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>ignoreseq ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * Force the target instruction to be considered as an unconditional branch.
 * Can only be put on a conditional branch instruction.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>multibranch ADDRESS to ADDRESS, ADDRESS, ... ;</tt></b> @n
 * List the different tagets of a multi-target control instruction
 * (switch-like construction).
 *
 * @li <b><tt>multicall ADDRESS to ADDRESS, ADDRESS, ... ;</tt></b> @n
 * List the different tagets of a multi-target call instruction
 * (function pointer call).
 *
 * @li <b><tt>nocall FUNCTION_ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * Process each call to the given function as a non-control instruction.
 * It may be useful to remove call to intrusive initialization function like
 * "__eabi" in main.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>doinline FUNCTION_ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * When virtualizing, calls to the given function will be inlined.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>noinline FUNCTION_ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * When virtualizing, calls to the given function will not be inlined.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>inlining-on FUNCTION_ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * When virtualizing the given function, default inlining policy
 * will be set to true.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>inlining-off FUNCTION_ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * When virtualizing the given function, default inlining policy
 * will be set to false.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>preserve ADDRESS ;</tt></b> @n
 * Ensure that flow fact loader will not change the addressed instruction.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>ignore entry STRING;</tt></b> @n
 * In some executable files, symbols are marked as function entries but are not,
 * possibly causing problems in instruction decoding. This problem may be avoided
 * by marking such symbols with this directive.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>library;</tt></b> @n
 * This command is marker informing that the current flow fact file is applied to
 * a library. The main effect is that if a label does not exist in the current executable,
 * instead of raising a fatal error, the matching flow fact is quietly ignored
 * considering that the label of the library is not linked in the current
 * executable.
 *
 * @par Syntactic items
 *
 * FUNCTION_ADDRESS may have one of the following form:
 * @li INTEGER: integer address,
 * @li STRING: double-quoted string that must match a program label,
 *
 * STEP may have one of the following form:
 * @li ADDRESS: simple address of a function,
 * @li @ ADDRESS: address of instruction calling the previous function.
 *
 * ADDRESS may have one of the following form:
 * @li INTEGER: integer address,
 * @li STRING: double-quoted string that must match a program label,
 * @li STRING <b><tt>+</tt></b> INTEGER: address relative to a label,
 * @li STRING <b><tt>-</tt></b> INTEGER: address back-relative to a label.
 *
 * INTEGER may have one of the following form:
 * @li {DECIMAL_DIGIT}+: decimal integer
 * @li <b><tt>0</tt></b>{OCTAL_DIGIT}+: octal integer
 * @li <b><tt>0x</tt></b>{HEXADECIMAL_DIGIT}+: hexadecimal integer
 * @li <b><tt>0b</tt></b>{BINARY_DIGIT}+: binary integer
 *
 * @par Examples
 *
 * This example shows a program composed of two function, "main" and "ludcmp"
 * containing nested loops.
 *
 * @code
 * checksum "ludcmp.elf" 0xaa9b6952;
 *
 * // Function main
 * loop "main" + 0x40 6;
 *  loop "main" + 0x70 6;
 *
 * // Function ludcmp
 * loop "ludcmp" + 0x80 5;
 *   loop "ludcmp" + 0x108 5;
 *     loop "ludcmp" + 0x170 5;
 *   loop "ludcmp" + 0x2e0 5;
 *     loop "ludcmp" + 0x344 5;
 * loop "ludcmp" + 0x4a4 5;
 *   loop "ludcmp" + 0x4e0 5;
 * loop "ludcmp" + 0x654 5;
 *   loop "ludcmp" + 0x6a0 5;
 * @endcode
 *
 * This second example shows the use of contextual loop bounds, that is,
 * bounds only applied according the function call context. In this example,
 * the loop in "f" iterates 10 or 20 times according "f"'s caller being
 * "g1" or "g2". In addition, this flow facts states that the loop in the
 * second state iterates at most 50 times for the whole task run.
 *
 * @code
 * checksum "test.arm" 0xdac4ee63;
 *
 * // Function f
 * loop "f" + 0x24 10 in "f" / "g1" / "main";
 * loop "f" + 0x24 max 20 total 50 in "f" / "g2" / "main";
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par To Come
 * @li "branch ADDRESS to ADDRESS ;"
 * @li "loop ADDRESS max COUNT min COUNT ;"
 * @li "recursive ADDRESS max COUNT min COUNT ;"
 * @li "entry ADDRESS ;"
 * @li "entry NAME ;"
 *
 * @par Extensions
 * Flow fact files are very useful file to allow user to give more detail
 * on the behaviour of a program. This section presents some extensions that remain experimental.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>memory access <i>iaddr: ADDRESS</i> .. <i>lo: ADDRESS</i> .. <i>hi: ADDRESS</i> ;</tt></b> @n
 * Definition of the range <i>lo</i> to <i>hi</i> (exclusive) for the memory instruction at address <i>iaddr</i>.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>reg <i>NAME</i> = <i>DATA</i> ;</tt></b>
 * Allows to assign a value to a register. This value may be a simple integer or an address.
 *
 * @li <b><tt>mem [<i>TYPE</i>] <i>ADDRESS</i> = <i>DATA</i> ;<tt></b>
 * Assign a value in memory.<i>TYPE</i> may be one <tt>int8</tt>, <tt>uint8</tt>, <tt>int816</tt>, <tt>uint16</tt>,
 * <tt>int32</tt>, <tt>uint32</tt>, <tt>int64</tt>, <tt>uint64</tt>, <tt>float32</tt> or <tt>float64</tt>.
 * <i>DATA</i> supports several forms described below.
 *
 * <i>DATA</i> a bit complex but allows a lot of flexibility:
 * @li <b><i>ADDRESS</i></b> -- the easier form, a simple integer or an address,
 * @li <b>[ <i>ADDRESS</i> .. <i>ADDRESS</i> ]</b> -- an integer or address interval,
 * @li <b>( <i>ADDRESS</i>, <i>INTEGER<i>, <i>INTEGER</i> )</b> -- a CLP triple (b, d, n) representing the integer set { b + k d / 0 <= k <= n }.
