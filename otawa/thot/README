Thot V0.1
---------

Thot is a document generator taking as input a textual document
expressed in a wiki-like language (currently dokuwiki syntax is
supported but more will be added) and produces as output a nice
displayable document (HTML, Latex, PDF, etc). The main concept is to
make document-making as less painful as possible while unleashing
powerful textual dialect: the basic wiki syntax may be improved by
augmenting the syntax thanks to external modules.

Thot is delivered under the license GPL v2 delivered in the COPYING file.

To install Thot, unpack the archive containing it and type:
	> cd Thot-VXX/
	> make install

As a default, the install directory is /usr and thot command is installed
in /usr/bin. You can change the installation direcory to INSTALL-DIRECTORY
by typing:
	> make install PREFIX=INSTALL-DIRECTORY

For any problem, you can contact me to hugues.casse@laposte.net.
