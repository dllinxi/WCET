/**
 * @defgroup cfg	CFG (Control Flow Graph)
 *
 * This module allows to represents program as a Control Flow Graph (CFG).
 * The CFG is graph representation of the execution path of the program where
 * nodes, @ref BasicBlock, represents blocks of sequential instructions
 * and edges, @ref Edge, the control flow transitions between blocks.
 *
 * @section cfg-using Using the CFG
 *
 * Most analyses only read the CFG structure and either use the properties of the CFG,
 * or creates new properties. They only need to understand the structure of the CFG.
 *
 * Most classes, features and identifier are accessible in the header file:
 * @code
 * #include <otawa/cfg/features.h>
 * @endcode
 *
 * A CFG is made mainly of 3 classes:
 * @li @ref CFG -- the CFG itself providing entry and exit virtual nodes and the list of BB,
 * @li @ref BasicBlock -- a BB in the CFG with an address, a size, list of input edges and list of output edges,
 * @li @ref Edge -- an edge in the CFG linking a source BB with a target BB.
 *
 * These classes are subclasses of @ref PropList and therefore support properties.
 *
 * To visit a CFG, one has to start from either the entry, or the exit BB (that are not virtual blocks
 * and does not match any code in the program) and follows the edges (be aware that a CFG may contain
 * loops !). To get the outputting edges of a BB, the following code based on the iterator @ref BasicBlock::OutIterator
 * may apply:
 * @code
 * for(BasicBlock::OutIterator edge(bb); edge; edge++)
 * 		process(edge);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Another way to work CFG is to make the analysis class to inherit from one of the following standard
 * processors:
 * @li @ref CFGProcessor -- call method @ref CFGProcessor::processCFG() for each CFG in the task,
 * @li @ref BBProcessor -- call method @ref BBProcessor::processBB() for each BB of the CFGs of the task,
 * @li @ref EdgeProcessor -- call method @ref EdgeProcessor::processEdge() for each edge of the CFGs of the task.
 *
 * They will avoid the hassle work of traversing the different CFGs of the task and BB and edges inside the CFGs.
 *
 * As an example, the following analysis outputs the CFG and disassemble the instructions in the BB.
 * @code
 * class Disassembler: public BBProcessor {
 * protected:
 * 	virtual void processCFG(WorkSpace *ws, CFG *cfg) {
 * 		cout << "CFG " << cfg->label() << io::endl;
 * 		BBProcessor::processCFG(ws, cfg);
 * 	}
 *
 * 	virtual void processBB(WorkSpace *ws, CFG *cfg, BasicBlock *bb) {
 * 		if(bb->isEnd())
 * 			return;
 *		cout << "\t" << bb << io::endl;
 *		for(BasicBlock::InstIterator inst(bb); inst; inst++)
 *			cout << "\t\t" << inst->address() << "\t" << *inst << io::endl;
 * 	}
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * The traversal of the graph following edges requires the understanding of the kind of the edges:
 * @li  @ref Edge::NONE -- unused kind,
 * @li  @ref Edge::TAKEN -- represents a branch instruction that is taken (conditional or not),
 * @li  @ref Edge::NOT_TAKEN -- represents a branch instruction that is not-taken (only conditional),
 * @li  @ref Edge::CALL -- represents a sub-program (do not use the Edge::target() but Edge::calledCFG() to get the called CFG),
 * @li  @ref Edge::VIRTUAL -- one of special edges starting from the entry BB or leading to the exit BB,
 * @li  @ref Edge::VIRTUAL_CALL -- represents a sub-program call whose CFG has been inlined,
 * @li  @ref Edge::VIRTUAL_RETURN -- represents a sub-program return whose CFG has been inlined,
 * @li  @ref Edge::EXN_CALL -- represents an exception call whose CFG has been inlined,
 * @li  @ref Edge::EXN_RETURN represents an exception return whose CFG has been inlined,
 *
 * Notice that you shouldn't use the Edge::target() method for an edge of type Edge::CALL but instead
 * the Edge::calledCFG() that gives the CFG of the called sub-program.
 *
 * One may also observe that the CFG representation fully supports transformations like inlining
 * of called sub-program or the representation of a possible exception raise. As shown in the section
 * on the transformation of CFG, these transformations does not duplicate code or changes the original
 * program. Only the representation is modified and aims at improving the precision in some particular
 * cases. Whatevern the @ref Edge::VIRTUAL_CALL, @ref Edge::VIRTUAL_RETURN, @ref Edge::EXN_CALL and
 * @ref Edge::EXN_RETURN provides more information on the transformed CFG:
 * @li @ref CALLED_CFG -- put on virtual call and return edges, gives the original global CFG,
 * @li @ref RECURSIVE_LOOP -- put on the edge representing the recursive call of an inlined sub-program,
 * @li @ref VIRTUAL_RETURN_BLOCK -- put on the block performing the sub-program call, gives the basic block the sub-program returns to (useful to skip an inlined CFG).
 *
 * Finally, a CFG may be called at different points in the other CFGs of the program, the properties
 * @ref CALLED_BY hooked to the CFG allows to get the matching calling edges:
 * @code
 * for(Identifier<Edge *>::Getter edge(cfg, CALLED_BY); edge; edge++)
 * 		processCaller(cfg, edge);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section cfg-build Building the CFGs
 *
 * Once a program is loaded, OTAWA has only two information item on the structure of the program:
 * the block of bytes representing the program and the startup address of the program.
 * In addition, according to the option of linkage, other symbols may be available like
 * the entry points of the functions composing the program.
 *
 * From this, OTAWA must decode the instructions from these entry points and follows all execution
 * paths until fully decoding the program. This first phase is performed the @ref CFGBuilder analysis
 * that produces as an output, a @ref CFGInfo, the collection of all CFGs (one by function) of the
 * program. This phase is relatively complex and may fail because of:
 * @li errors in decoding the instructions (in this case, the error is signaled to the user and the execution path is aborted),
 * @li unresolved branches (mainly because of computed branch target as found in function pointer call or in some switch compilation schemes).
 *
 * For the latter case, you can help @ref CFGBuilder by providing information on the possible branches
 * using the properties below:
 * @li @ref IS_RETURN -- consider the marked instruction as a return,
 * @li @ref NO_RETURN -- mark the function as not returning,
 * @li @ref NO_CALL -- avoid to involve in the CFGs the function whose first instruction is marked,
 * @li @ref IGNORE_CONTROL -- ignore the control effect of the marked instruction,
 * @li @ref IGNORE_SEQ -- only on a conditional branching instruction, ignore the sequential path,
 * @li @ref BRANCH_TARGET -- gives the target(s) of an indirect branch instruction,
 * @li @ref CALL_TARGET -- gives the target(s) of an indirect call instruction.
 *
 * This properties are usually set by the @ref FlowFactLoader from textual or XML files. Once may also observe
 * that this properties allows also to change artificially the control flow according to the needs of a user.
 * For example, one can avoid the "printf" function to be called by putting a property @ref NO_CALL on its entry
 * instruction.
 *
 * Once the global CFGs of the program are built, the user is usually interested only in a subset
 * of CFGS corresponding to the task the WCET is computed for. This subset is gathered by the
 * @ref CFGCollector analysis from one of the following properties:
 * @li @ref TASK_ENTRY (in the configuration properties)
 * @li @ref ENTRY_CFG (in the configuration properties or on the workspace)
 * @li @ref CFGCollector::ADDED_CFG -- CFG to add to the collection,
 * @li @ref CFGCollection::ADD_FUNCTION -- function to add to the collection.
 *
 * As a result, the @ref INVOLVED_CFGS (type @ref CFGCollection) hooked to the workspace provides
 * this list of functions that is used by the following analyses to perform the WCET computation.
 * Notices that the first CFG of the collection is the entry point of the task. Remark also that
 * the obtained CFG are a copy of the original CFG of the global decoding of the program: this means
 * that you add as many properties to the collected CFG without impacting the CFGs of the global
 * analysis.
 *
 *
 * @section cfg-loop Loops in the CFGs
 *
 * Loops are a common shared issue when handling CFG. OTAWA provides several way to cope with
 * loops. First two features allows to identify loops: @ref LOOP_HEADERS_FEATURE and @ref LOOP_INFO_FEATURE.
 *
 * The @ref LOOP_HEADERS_FEATURE allows to identify the loops in the CFG. Basically, it finds the
 * back-edges (edges causing the looping) and, from these, the header of the loops. Each loop
 * is defined by its header basic block that is the first basic block traversed when entering
 * a loop. An header basic block is the header of only one loop and is a good way to identify the loop.
 * The following properties are set:
 * @li @ref LOOP_HEADER -- evaluates to true when the hooked basic block is a loop header,
 * @li @ref BACK_EDGE -- evaluates to true on a back-edge (the target of the edge is the loop header).
 *
 * This feature is implemented by the @ref Dominance analysis or @ref SpanningTreeBuilder.
 *
 * If @ref LOOP_HEADERS_FEATURE provides minimal information on a loop, @ref LOOP_INFO_FEATURE
 * allows to get full details sometimes for some analyses. The following properties are set:
 * @li @ref ENCLOSING_LOOP_HEADER -- gives the header of the loop enclosing the linked BB,
 * @li @ref LOOP_EXIT_EDGE -- on an edge, informs it is an exit edgen,
 * @li @ref EXIT_LIST -- put on the loop header, get the list of edges exiting the loop.
 *
 * As shown above, the loop handled by OTAWA supports only one entry point and header.
 * This is a classic definition of so-called "regular" loops. Even if this is the most common
 * loop found, some programs exhibit "irregular" loops (at least, two possible entry point).
 * A usual way to support such a loop is to choose one entry point and to duplicate the code
 * of the other entry points: this may be done in OTAWA using the analysis @ref LoopReductor.
 *
 *
 * @section cfg-transform Transforming the CFG
 *
 * CFGs in OTAWA are designed to be light representation of the program, that is, they support
 * duplication with a minimal cost in term of memory footprint. This means, for example,
 * that the precision of the computed WCET may be improved by duplicating some parts of the CFG
 * to cope more precisely with the context of the code. Several OTAWA code processors
 * provide such transformations.
 *
 * The @ref Virtualizer allows to inline the called function at the location they are called.
 * Therefore, if a function is called at several locations, this allows to duplicate the BB
 * and the edges representing the function and, instead to melt the context information,
 * to have a context as precise as possible. Yet, such a transformation may be costly in terms
 * of number of BB and must be used carefully. To prevent such a size explosion,
 * you can mark a CFG as @ref DONT_INLINE to prevent the inlining.
 *
 * Unrolling loops is another way to improve precision. As many loop body have a different
 * behavior between the first iteration and the other one (cache load, etc), it may be interesting
 * to unroll loops once. This may be performed using the code processor @ref LoopUnroller.
 *
 * Finally, some transformations are required by a particular architecture. This is the case
 * of instruction sets with delayed branches. Delayed branches executes the instruction following
 * the branch instruction before performing actually the control flow change. As an outcome,
 * the instruction following a branch is really part of the basic block the branch is contained in.
 * This policy is different from the usual way OTAWA builds CFGs and a transformation must be done
 * to fix the basic blocks: this is performed by @ref DelayedBuilder.
 *
 *
 * @section cfg-io Input / Output in XML
 * This modules provides two code processors allowing to perform input / output
 * on CFG. @ref CFGSaver save the CFG of the current task to a file while
 * @ref CFGLoader allows to load it back.
 *
 * Both processors uses the same XML format defined below:
 * @code
 * <?xml version="1.0" ?>
 * <otawa-workspace>
 *
 * 		<cfg id="ID" entry="ID" exit="ID">
 * 			<bb id="ID" address="ADDRESS"? size="INT"?/>*
 * 			<edge kind="KIND" source="ID" target="ID"? cfg="ID"?/>*
 *		</cfg>*
 *
 * </otawa-workspace>
 * @endcode
 *
 * The OTAWA workspace is viewed, in the CFG representation, as a set of CFG
 * that, in turn, is made of several basic blocks linked by edges. Each CFG and BB
 * is identified with the attribute "id", any textual unique value, allowing
 * to reference them.
 *
 * The cfg element must reference two specific BB (using the unique "id"), an entry BB
 * and an exit BB. The BB is defined by its address and its size (in bytes).
 * The edges are defined by their kind, the source BB and, depending on the type,
 * the target BB or the called CFG (@ref Edge::CALL). The latter attribute "cfg"
 * must give the identifier of an existing CFG.
