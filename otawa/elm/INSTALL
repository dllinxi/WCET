====== Installation ======

===== Requirements =====

  * GCC (or MinGW GCC)
  * CMake
  * libxml2, libxslt (optional)

==== To install =====

to install in directory DIR:

<code sh>
> cd elm
> cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=DIR
> make install
</code>

The type of installation may be selected from the ''cmake''
using ''INSTALL_TYPE'' definition:
<code sh>
> cmake . -DINSTALL_TYPE=type
</code>

With //type// one of:
  * all -- install all,
  * dev-only -- to install header files and documentation,
  * dev -- same as above with library installation,
  * lib -- install libraries themselves,
  * bin -- install libraries and commands.

  
==== Getting Statistics ====
  
Some data structure provides statistics about their internal work: efficiency, memory footprint, etc.
As these features are not essential for the work of these data structures and as they may take place
or time, they are only compiled conditionally by passing this option to CMake:

<code sh>
> cmake . -DELM_STAT
</code>

The name of these special methods are usually prefixed by "_stat_".
