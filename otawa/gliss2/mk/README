====== How to use this Makefile ? =====

===== Making your project =====

Copy both files, ''Makefile'' and ''config.mk.in'', at the top-level of your ISA directory.

Edit ''Makefile'':
  * fix the ''ARCH'' with the name of your ISA,
  * fix ''MAIN_NMP'' with the name of the NMP file,
  * fix ''NMP'' to add other NMP file.

As in the example below:
<code makefile>
ARCH= avr

# main NMP file here
MAIN_NMP	= avr.nmp	

# list of NMP files
NMP = 	nmp/$(MAIN_NMP) \
		nmp/state.nmp \
		nmp/alu.nmp \
		nmp/mem.nmp \
		nmp/control.nmp
</code>

We assume that the NMP files are stored in ''nmp'' directory but may easily change this.

You may also consider that these files are just a base for your ISA and modify them according to your needs.
Just keep in mind to isolate configurable items in ''config.mk.in''.

===== How to build your project? =====
