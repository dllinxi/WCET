FRONTC DEPENDENCY

FrontC library is required to build oRange.
Just unpack and compile its sources at the same level as the oRange directory.
FrontC may be obtained as source package from http://www.irit.fr/recherches/ARCHI/MARCH/frontc.

> wget http://www.irit.fr/recherches/ARCHI/MARCH/frontc/Frontc-3.4.tgz
> tar xvfz Frontc-3.4.tgz
> cd ..
> ln -s Frontc-3.4 frontc

Or checked out form CVS:
> cvs co -r :pserver:anonymous@cvs.irit.fr:/usr/local/CVS_IRIT/CVS_OTAWA

In both cases, to compile FrontC:
> cd frontc
> make



BUILDING ORANGE

> cd orange
> make

oRange executable may be found in "main/orange".
