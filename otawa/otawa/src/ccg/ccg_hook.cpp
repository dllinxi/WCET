 * @defgroup ccg CCG Plugin
 *
 * CCG (Cache Conflict Graph) provides a method to compute the number of misses
 * of a direct-mapped instruction cache based on a graph representation
 * of the cache states translated as a set of constraints. An extension exists
 * for A-way LRU caches but is not implemented in OTAWA.
