 */

/**
 * @page proc_concepts Processor Concepts
 * @ingroup proc
 *
 * @par Features
 *
 * A feature represents a set of services that are available on the program representation.
 * These services are provided either by the program loader, or by a previous analysis.
 * These services are composed of:
 * @li properties linked to the program representation,
 * @li methods providing meaninful results in the objefct of the program representation.
 *
 * The feature are an easier way to inform the framework that some services are provided
 * and to group properties and methods in logical sets. A feature is mainly implemented
 * by an @ref otawa::AbstractFeature.
 *
 * It may be implemented by a simple @ref otawa::Feature with a default code processor
 * (see below) to satisfy the service if it is not provided. As the goal of feature is
 * to share some data between analyses, it is first declared in a header file, for
 * example "my_feature.h" :
 * @code
 * #include <otawa/proc/Feature.h>
 * #include "MyDefaultProcessor.h"
 *
 * extern Feature<MyDefaultProcessor> MY_FEATURE;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then, it must defined in a source file, for example, "my_feature.cpp":
 * @code
 * #include "my_feature.h"
 *
 * Feature<MyDefaultProcessor> MY_FEATURE("MY_FEATURE");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that a feature must have a unique name: duplicate names in features names will be
 * detected at system startup and will cause abortion of the application. Although it is
 * not mandatory, it is advised (1) to give a name in uppercase with underscores to separe
 * names and (2) to give the full-qualified C++ name. This last property will help to
 * retrieve features when dynamic module loading is used.
 *
 * The way proposed above to declare a feature has a drawback: it is costly in computation
 * time as it requires the user to include the default processor class.
 * To avoid this, OTAWA propose to use the  @ref otawa::SilentFeature class.
 * In this cas, the header file will become:
 * @code
 * #include <otawa/proc/SilentFeature.h>
 *
 * extern SilentFeature MY_FEATURE;
 * @endcode
 *
 * The, the source file is a bit more complex as it must now design the default processor:
 * @code
 * #include "my_feature.h"
 * #include "MyDefaultProcessor"
 *
 * static SilentFeature::Maker<MyDefaultProcessor> MY_MAKER;
 * SilentFeature MY_FEATURE("MY_FEATURE", MY_MAKER);
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @par Code Processors
 *
 * A code processor performs an analysis, that is, scan the program representation,
 * extracts some properties and provide them to the remaining analyses. To organize the
 * properties, they are grouped logically in features. To organize this work, the
 * code processors records themselves to OTAWA in order to:
 * @li ensures that the required features are available,
 * @li inform that the processor computes some new features.
 *
 * Consequently, in OTAWA, analyses are packaged inside code processors
 * (@ref otawa::Processor) that manages the features but also provides other
 * facilities:
 * @li configuration of the processor work,
 * @li control of output streams,
 * @li statistics gathering,
 * @li details about the computation
 * @li several classes to make analysis writing easier (CFG processor, BB processor,
 * contextual processor and so on),
 * @li resource cleanup.
 *
 * This class provides also a common way to invoke analyses. The configuration
 * is perform in a property list structure:
 * @code
 * PropList props;
 * CONFIGURATION_1(props) = value1;
 * CONFIGURATION_2(props) = value2;
 * ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then, the processor object is simply created and invoked on a workspace:
 * @code
 * MyProcessor proc;
 * proc.process(workspace, props);
 * @endcode
 *
 * For example, to redirect the log output of the processor and to activate
 * verbosity, and to compute the domination in a CFG, we may do:
 * @code
 * PropList props;
 * Processor::VERBOSE(props) = true;
 * Processor::LOG(props) = System::newFile("my_log.txt");
 * Domination dom;
 * dom.process(workspace, props);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Notice that the configuration properties are passed to all processor invoked to provided
 * features required by the invoked processor.
 *
 *
 * @par Processor Registration
 *
 * Code processors or analyzers can be invoked explicitly from C++ code, implicitly
 * by requiring a feature or from a script (see @ref Script class or @c owcet command).
 * In the latter case, the processor name is used to retrieve its code and to allow
 * to create an instance.
 *
 * As C++ does not provide any reflexive information to find back the constructor of a class,
 * the code processor need to record in the main registry of OTAWA. To achieve, it must
 * declare a static object (1) that will record itself to the main registry and (2) that
 * provides all details of the code processor to the OTAWA framework:
 * @li the name
 * @li the version
 * @li required and/or used features,
 * @li invalidated features,
 * @li provided features,
 * @li configuration properties,
 * @li the constructor,
 * @li possibly its base processor (as a default, all processor have for base otawa::Processor).
 *
 * Although this registration can be achieved in different ways, the current preferred way requires
 * to declare, as public members, a static attribute named @c reg and a constructor taking an AbstractRegistration
 * with @c reg as default value. The constructor definition allows to pass the actual registration of the subclass
 * (that is including the one of the current class) to the OTAWA framework.
 * @code
 * class MyProcessor: public BBProcessor {
 * public:
 * 		static p::declare reg;
 * 		MyProcessor(AbstractRegistration& r = reg): BBProcessor(r) { ... }
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * In turn, the @c static attribute must be declared with the details of the code processor
 * in the source file:
 * @code
 * p::declare MyProcessor::reg =
 * 	p::init("MyProcessor", Version(1, 0, 0))
 * 	.base(BBProcessor::reg),
 * 	.require(CFG_COLLECTED_FEATURE)
 * 	.provide(MY_FEATURE)
 * 	.make<MyProcessor>();
 * @endcode
