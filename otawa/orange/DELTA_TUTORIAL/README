a tutorial for orange and the delta analysis. examples contains all
the example files mentioned in the slides (found in folder demo_slides).



--- description from an email I sent to Armelle:


The tutorial folder, it contains:

- demo_slides folder: the tex, and images to build the slides

		you might need to install 'pygmentize', since
		I use 'minted' for source code listings.

	I added another example (examples/hon.c) and a few
	experiments/questions that can be answered by running
	the delta tool (it's 9 questions). Although somewhat
	similar, there are a few things to do.

	I don't know, you might want to rearrange the slides a bit,
	however you prefere.

	In principle it contains the following 'sections':
	
		1) why deltas/what for, related to the conti module
		2) illustrate output of orange (ffx, loopfacts)
		   (using rex.c)
		3) illustrate delta output (rex.c)
		4) conti use-case example, gains, scenario etc
		   (step by step illustration how we would
		    analyze an_is)
		5) hon.c + questions


- examples folder: contains all the sources

	rex.c: the file that is used to illustrate the output ffx
	       and the delta list in the slides. (the purple-on-black-
	       red-arrow images).

	hon: contains hon.c and a few input ffx files. this is the
	     source that should be analyzed to answer the 9 questions.
	     (it's again a nonsensical example, solutions and 		
	      invokations are in the slides, the input ffx files can
	      be found in the folder)

	an_is_no_scenario: the original conti module

	an_is_scenario: same, original module, with in.ffx,
                  the delta scenario

	an_is_renamed: the source code with variables renamed to random
                 strings
	
	an_is_10_highest_deltas: list of the 10 highest delta conds

	an_is_cfg_param_vars.csv: the conti parameter list. this one and
				  the 10_highest_delta are used in the
				  'syntactic matching' part (the small
				  shellscript).
