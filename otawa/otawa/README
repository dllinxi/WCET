OTAWA 0.9, code named "SOON" (05.17.13)

  OTAWA (Open Tool for Adaptive WCET Analysis) is a framework of C++ classes
dedicated to static analyses of programs in machine code and to the computation
f WCET (Worst Case Execution Time).

  OTAWA is freely available (under the LGPL licence) and is developed by the
TRACES (http://www.irit.fr/recherches/ARCHI/MARCH/) team at IRIT labs
(http://www.irit.fr), universit√© Paul Sabatier, France.

  OTAWA provides state-of-art WCET analyses like IPET (Implicit Path Enumeration
Technique) and a lot of facilities to work on binary programs (control flow
graphs, loop detection and so on).

  OTAWA supports successfully many architecture as PowerPC or M68HC.
More ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) are currently under development like
ARM or TriCore.
